                            <h3>When Should You Replace Your Router</h3>
                            <div class="myborder"></div>
                            <img src="../assets/images/when-should-you-replace-your-router.jpg"
                                alt="when-should-you-replace-your-router.jpg">
                            <p>Have you had the same router for years now and are wondering when or if you should be replacing it anytime soon? Many of us still have the router that our internet service providers installed for us five or even ten years ago, and they are still chugging along, probably quite well in some cases. One might say that is all you could ever ask for, that your router continues to provide internet, and it is all out of sight and out of mind. However, there are several problems with this line of thinking because it leaves out considerations about security and modern features that tend to get taken for granted.</p>

                            <h5>Security Firewall</h5>
                            <p>Your router does far more than simply provide you an internet connection. It also acts as a security firewall between your home devices and the outside world, keeping malicious hackers out. Most modern routers also come equipped with Wi-Fi technology, which opens up a whole new domain of security. Technology is ever-evolving, and a router from ten years ago are likely to be missing some essential features necessary for today’s environment. If you want to have better protection, upgrading is not a bad idea.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Performance</h5>
                            <p>Routers lose performance over time, and one of the first indicators of this is your wireless signal and internet performance. If your signal strength is lacking every time you move to another room or if you find yourself in need of a wireless repeater or signal booster, your router's power output is likely on the decline. It is also possible that you have a good signal, but webpages and online content load at snail pace. This could be a sign of wireless congestion, meaning the router cannot keep up with the parade of wireless devices in your home. These are both strong indicators that your router is in pressing need of an upgrade.</p>
                            <h5>Security Features</h5>
                            <p>Another dimension of router obsolescence is the lack of modern security features. WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) started becoming available in 2019 and holds vast advantages over the classic WPA, WPA2, and especially WEP. With WPA3, passwords are far harder to crack. Even with WPA2-AES encryption, which is some of the strongest you can get, an attacker can run what is called a dictionary-based attached and try to guess your password.
                            </p>
                            <p>WPA3, on the other hand, requires an attacker to interact with your wireless router for each password attempt, which significantly reduces the risk of someone gaining access. Even if an attacker is able to figure out your password, they will not be able to do much with it as they could with WPA2. WPA3 has what is called “forward secrecy.” If an attacker captures encrypted data from your device and learns your password, they will not be able to decrypt that old data they obtained. They would only be able to decrypt newly captured information, which gives you the ability to change your password before they do.</p>
                            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                            <p>If you notice any issues with your internet performance, then that may be the red flag to replace your router. However, do not wait until that point to start thinking about an upgrade. Sure, you can leave your router alone as long as it is performing, but as you can see from above, you are at a much higher risk of security issues if your router is too outdated. When you have a moment, think about how long ago your router was installed and how many advancements have come out since then. If you find that it is significant, then it is highly suggested you look for a replacement before you have more vital issues on your hands.
