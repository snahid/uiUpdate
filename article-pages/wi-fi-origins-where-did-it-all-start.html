                            <h3>Wi-Fi Origins – Where Did It All Start?</h3>
                            <div class="myborder"></div>
                            <img src="../assets/images/wi-fi-origins-where-did-it-all-start.jpg"
                                alt="wi-fi-origins-where-did-it-all-start.jpg">
                            <p>We all use this technology every day, and few of us stop to think where it all began. We
                                can’t really remember a time when we didn’t walk into an office, restaurant, home or
                                shopping mall and immediately ask, “What’s the Wi-Fi password?” All we know is that it’s
                                made out lives significantly easier. And communication is now almost seamless. Here, we
                                take a look at when this technology was first released, who used it, and how it’s
                                changed over the years.</p>
                            <h5>When was it invented?</h5>
                            <p>This innovative networking technology was first launched back in 1997 by a team of
                                inventors. Because of the complexity of this technology, and because there were several
                                components involved in the process of creating Wi-Fi, we can’t say there is one single
                                inventor. As with most new technologies, the invention of Wi-Fi was based on
                                pre-existing components such as the 802.11 standards (radio frequency) and electronic
                                equipment used to transmit a Wi-Fi signal.
                            </p>
                            <p>However, there is one man who is known as ‘the father of Wi-Fi’. That’s because he
                                chaired the committee that created the 802.11 standards that would lead to making Wi-Fi
                                possible. His name is Vic Hayes. And he was, first and foremost, a Dutch senior
                                researcher at the Delft University of Technology. He is also a top engineer. Other
                                people credited for introducing Wi-Fi to the world include Australian electrical
                                engineer, Dr John O’Sullivan, research scientist and radio astronomer Dr Terry Percival,
                                physics expert and developer Mr Diet Ostry, senior scientist Mr Graham Daniels, and
                                software developer Mr John Deane.</p>

                            <h5>Where was it first used, and what for?</h5>
                            <p>It was first used by consumers in 1997, but it took a while before the technology really
                                took off around the world. It was, and still is, mostly used in a personal capacity in
                                people’s offices, homes and restaurants. The Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania
                                was the first university to offer students access to a campus-wide wireless internet
                                network, and that was back in 1993. In the early 2000s, cities all over the world
                                started thinking about offering Wi-Fi networks that would be available to the public
                                anywhere in that city. One of the first places to initiate this was Mysuru in India.
                                Then the American cities of St Cloud and Florida followed.</p>
                            <h5>How has the technology changed over the years?</h5>
                            <p>Wi-Fi has been around for over 20 years now, and new developments and upgrades are
                                continuously being made. More and more, we’re seeing free Wi-Fi access points being set
                                up in public places such as airports, parks and shopping malls. It’s easy to install,
                                safe to use, and helps you stay connected both personally and professionally.</p>
                            <p>We’re also becoming increasingly inter-connected as devices like smartphones, laptops and
                                even home automation systems start to sync. The so-called Internet of Things is an
                                exciting new stage of this innovative technology.</p>
                            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                            <p>After reading this, and doing plenty of research, it’s clear that Wi-Fi is not as simple
                                as it seems. However, we as consumers are becoming more dependent on it. When it’s down,
                                we feel almost helpless and, when it’s running, we forget it exists as our lives are
                                made that much easier. No matter where it began, we can’t imagine a world without Wi-Fi.
